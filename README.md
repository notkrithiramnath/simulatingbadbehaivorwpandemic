# simulatingbadbehaivorwpandemic

This was a project I made in my senior year in High school for our regional science fairs. 

  Whether its Chicago cops using unjustified violence or teenagers vandalizing a stop sign, numerous studies have shown the correlation between the “goodness” of people around someone and that person’s actions, and how bad behavior often spreads like a contagion. Sometimes the company an individual keeps is not the only factor, in countries like Italy the societal culture against taxes makes their rates of tax evasion alarming  when compared to other developed countries in the region. Whereas in countries like Denmark where following the rules is embedded in society, despite higher taxes their cheating rates are incredibly low.
  
  In this project I use Object-Oriented-Programming in Python to create a discrete event simulation. I model a scenario of a country collecting taxes and folks evading taxes or paying them. I simulate a “bad virus” that spreads through a population with other viruses that counteract it. These “good viruses” are a fear of verification or a fear of punishment that arises when the government randomly audits someone and discovers the bad virus. The “good” contagion model ways governments can target bad behavior and reduce its spread.
 
  I model governments with variables pulled from real life, namely Italy, the US, and Denmark.. Italy has a very high tax evasion rate and has been focusing on implementing more auditing to discover if that would force their evasion rates to drop. The United States has a “normal” number of evasions and a lower audit rate. Denmark has a low auditing rate and a miraculously low cheating rate.
 
  I also evaluate the costs associated with each virus. Auditing costs a large amount of money, and when someone is punished their contribution to a government’s GDP is missing. Also, when the government audits someone and they are not “bad”, the government's reputation slightly drops. In the short term, the monetary and reputation costs will not decrease, but if too many audits and punishments are performed these numbers will drop significantly.
